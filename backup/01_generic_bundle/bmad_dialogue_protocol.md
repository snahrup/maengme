# BMAD Dialogue Protocol (Slack-style)
- Prefix messages with role, e.g., `Arthur/Architect:`
- Keep steps atomic. When unsure, ask **Alex/Analyst** for a clarifying stub.
- Orchestrator coordinates and merges drafts; Quinn/QA appends acceptance tests.
- Every sprint: Standup → Implement → Review → QA → Ship → Retrospective.
