# MaengMe — Session Handoff Log

## Latest Status ✅
- **Branch:** master  
- **Last commit:** 2f42dec - Add complete kratom product database with all 9 products
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/snahrup/maengme
- **Dev Server:** http://localhost:5180/ (currently running)
- **Build:** ✅ Working

## Session Update - December 20, 2024

### What Changed
1. **Complete Product Database Implementation**
   - Added all 9 kratom products with full details
   - OPMS Silver Line: Red Sumatra, Green Borneo, White Indo, Green Thai, Green Malay
   - Mit Therapy Regular: Mixed Maeng Da Extract, Red Bali & White Elephant Extract
   - Mit Therapy Onyx: White Banda & Red Maluku, Super Sumatra & White Mukomuko
   - Each product includes: alkaloid profiles, timing data, dosage guidelines, effects, warnings
   - Proper image paths linking to existing product images in `/products/`

2. **Data Collection Mechanism (Step 1 of 3 - IN PROGRESS)**
   - Created `sessionAnalytics.ts` service for collecting real timing data
   - Added analytics types in `sessionAnalytics.ts`
   - Updated database schema with analytics tables (version 2)
   - Created `EffectTracker.tsx` component for user effect logging
   - Partially integrated analytics into `ActiveSession.tsx`
   - Analytics tracks: session start/end, laps, effect strength, phase changes

### Current State
- **App running:** Port 5180
- **Last action:** Working on integrating effect tracking into ActiveSession
- **Status:** ActiveSession component partially updated, needs completion

### Open Items
- Complete ActiveSession.tsx integration (file was partially written)
- Implement ML-based timing predictions (Step 2)
- Add user-adjustable timing profiles (Step 3)
- Test the complete analytics flow
- Add data visualization for collected metrics

### Next Actions
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Complete ActiveSession.tsx component with effect tracking UI
2. Create ML prediction service using collected data
3. Add timing adjustment UI for users to calibrate
4. Create analytics dashboard to view collected data
5. Test complete flow: session → data collection → ML prediction → adjusted timings

### Assumptions Made
- Effect strength on 1-10 scale
- Phase detection based on elapsed time initially
- Analytics auto-saves to IndexedDB
- Session IDs generated from timestamp

### Files Touched
- **Created:** 
  - `src/types/sessionAnalytics.ts` - Analytics type definitions
  - `src/services/sessionAnalytics.ts` - Analytics service
  - `src/components/EffectTracker.tsx` - Effect logging UI
- **Modified:**
  - `src/data/productsDatabase.ts` - Complete product data
  - `src/store/database.ts` - Added analytics tables
  - `src/components/ActiveSession.tsx` - Partial integration (INCOMPLETE)

### Critical Notes
- **ActiveSession.tsx is incomplete** - was in middle of adding UI when context limit approached
- Analytics service is ready but not fully integrated
- Database migration to v2 will happen automatically on next app load
- Effect tracker component complete and ready to use

### Timing Data Context
User asked about timing estimates - confirmed they are:
- **NOT based on actual product data**
- Currently using generalized kratom pharmacokinetics
- Extracts: faster onset/shorter duration
- Regular leaf: slower onset/longer duration
- This is WHY we're building the analytics system - to collect REAL data

### Implementation Status
**Step 1: Data Collection** - 70% complete
- ✅ Analytics types defined
- ✅ Database schema updated
- ✅ Analytics service created
- ✅ Effect tracker UI built
- ⚠️ ActiveSession integration incomplete
- ❌ Testing needed

**Step 2: ML Predictions** - 0% complete
**Step 3: User Adjustments** - 0% complete

### For Next Session
Priority: Complete ActiveSession.tsx integration, then move to ML predictions. The foundation is solid but needs the UI connection finished.
