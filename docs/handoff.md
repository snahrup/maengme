## Session Update - January 3, 2025, 5:00 PM

### What Changed
- **Updated Product Pages to Blue Theme**
  - Replaced all green accents with blue (#1DA1FF → #007AFF gradient)
  - ProductSelector: Updated package icon, search focus border, filter buttons, chevron hover, stats text
  - ProductDetails: Updated all green elements to blue (icons, buttons, progress bars)
  - Consistent with StartScreen's blue ring aesthetic
  - Start Session button now uses blue gradient with white text
  
- **Color Replacements Made**:
  - Package icon: green-400 → blue-400
  - Focus borders: green-400/50 → blue-400/50
  - Selected filters: green-500/30 → blue-500/30
  - Hover states: hover:text-green-400 → hover:text-blue-400
  - Button gradients: from-green-500 to-green-600 → from-[#1DA1FF] to-[#007AFF]
  - Accent colors in stats and timeline

### Current State
- App running on http://localhost:5178/
- TypeScript compilation successful - no errors
- Blue theme consistently applied across product pages
- **ISSUE**: Navigation flow still broken - can't navigate from ProductDetails to ActiveSession

### Open Items
- **CRITICAL**: Fix navigation from ProductDetails → ActiveSession (carried over)
- End confirmation modal ready but untested due to navigation issue
- Bell curve visualization needs real-time updates
- Quick start feature not implemented
- PWA features not implemented

### Next Actions
1. **Debug navigation issue** - Find why Start Session doesn't reach ActiveSession
2. **Test full flow once fixed** - Start → Track doses → End → Verify in stats
3. **Test end confirmation modal** - Ensure it prevents accidental data loss
4. **Implement quick start** - Remember last product/dose
5. **Add PWA features** - Service worker for offline support

### Assumptions Made
- Blue theme should match StartScreen's gradient (#1DA1FF → #007AFF)
- All green accents should be replaced with blue
- Vein colors (red, green, white, yellow) remain unchanged
- Glass effects should stay at 5-10% opacity
- Yellow/orange colors for warnings and duration remain unchanged

### Files Touched
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/components/ProductSelector.tsx` (updated to blue theme)
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/components/ProductDetails.tsx` (updated to blue theme)

## Navigation Issue Details
- Start Session button in ProductDetails should trigger handleStartWithPreset
- This should set activePreset and change currentView to 'session'
- Currently seems to reload or stay on same view
- Needs debugging of App.tsx state flow and view transitions

## Current Issues
- ⚠️ **Navigation broken**: Can't reach ActiveSession from ProductDetails
- ✅ Blue theme successfully applied to product pages
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passing
- ✅ Dev server running on port 5178

## Testing Notes
- Home screen shows blue ring animation correctly
- Product selector opens but navigation to details may be affected
- Blue theme consistent across visible components
- Need to verify ActiveSession once navigation fixed

## Next Session Priority
1. Fix the navigation issue in App.tsx - debug handleStartWithPreset
2. Test the complete flow with new blue theme
3. Verify end confirmation modal works
4. Test session saves and stats display
