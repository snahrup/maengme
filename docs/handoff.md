## Session Update - January 3, 2025, 9:10 PM

### MAJOR PROGRESS - User Management System Started! 🚀

### What Changed This Session

#### **Fixes Applied**
1. ✅ **Fixed TypeScript Build Error** - Changed `session.duration` to `session.totalElapsed` in PredictivePeakIndicator
2. ✅ **Navigation Debugging** - Added extensive logging and delayed state update to diagnose session view issue

#### **User Authentication System - Phase 1 Started**
1. **LoginScreen Component** ✅
   - Glass morphism design matching app theme
   - Username/email + password fields
   - Remember me checkbox functionality
   - Show/hide password toggle
   - Error handling with animations
   - Forgot password link
   - Sign up redirect
   - Loading states with spinners

2. **SignUpScreen Component** ✅
   - Two-step registration process
   - Step 1: Username and email
   - Step 2: Password with strength indicator
   - Real-time password strength calculation (5 levels)
   - Password confirmation with match indicator
   - Terms of service checkbox
   - Back navigation between steps
   - Progress dots indicator

3. **AuthContext Provider** ✅
   - User state management
   - Login/signup/logout methods
   - Profile update capability
   - Token management (localStorage/sessionStorage)
   - Authentication check on mount
   - Loading states
   - Mock implementation ready for Supabase integration

### Current State
- App running on http://localhost:5184/
- Build successful - Netlify deployment should work
- Auth components created but not integrated into main app yet
- Navigation issue has debug logging in place

### Animation Features Status
- ✅ Phase 1: AdaptiveParticles + BreathingGlow
- ✅ Phase 2: NeuralSynapseNetwork + PredictivePeakIndicator
- ⚠️ Can't test animations until navigation to ActiveSession is fixed

### Next Actions - User Management

#### **Immediate (Next Hour)**
1. Integrate auth screens into App.tsx
2. Add auth routing logic
3. Create ProtectedRoute component
4. Test login/signup flow

#### **Phase 2: Onboarding System**
1. Create WelcomeFlow component
2. Build InteractiveTutorial with spotlight
3. Add progress tracking
4. Force-click important features

#### **Phase 3: AI Assessment with Aria**
1. Create Aria persona component
2. Integrate Claude API for conversation
3. Build profile extraction logic
4. Natural language processing

### Next Actions - MaengMe Support Staff (MSS)

#### **Aria - Wellness Navigator** 🧭
- Onboarding specialist
- Warm orange accent (#FF9500)
- ElevenLabs voice integration pending
- Conversational assessment flow

#### **Dr. Sage - Analytics Expert** 📊
- Lives in stats/analytics pages
- Cool blue accent
- Tapering strategies
- Pattern recognition

#### **Luna - Session Companion** 🌙

### Files Created/Modified Today
- Created: `src/components/auth/LoginScreen.tsx` (180 lines)
- Created: `src/components/auth/SignUpScreen.tsx` (347 lines)
- Created: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (162 lines)
- Modified: `src/components/PredictivePeakIndicator.tsx` (fixed duration bug)
- Modified: `src/App.tsx` (added navigation debugging)

### Tech Stack Decisions
- **Auth**: Mock implementation ready for Supabase
- **State**: React Context for auth management
- **Styling**: Glass morphism throughout
- **Validation**: Client-side with server-side pending
- **Tokens**: JWT strategy with remember me option

### TODOs for Next Session
1. **CRITICAL**: Fix navigation to ActiveSession
2. Wire up auth screens to App.tsx
3. Create user profile screen
4. Build onboarding flow with Aria
5. Set up Supabase backend
6. Test complete auth flow

### Known Issues
- ⚠️ Navigation to ActiveSession still broken
- ⚠️ Auth is mocked - needs Supabase integration
- ⚠️ No password reset flow yet
- ⚠️ No email verification

### Implementation Notes

#### Password Strength Algorithm
```javascript
// 5 levels: Weak, Fair, Good, Strong, Very Strong
- Length >= 8
- Contains lowercase
- Contains uppercase
- Contains numbers
- Contains special characters
```

#### Auth Token Strategy
- Remember Me: localStorage (30 days)
- Normal login: sessionStorage (browser session)
- Refresh tokens: TODO with Supabase

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials
- [ ] Sign up with weak password
- [ ] Sign up with strong password
- [ ] Remember me persistence
- [ ] Logout clears tokens
- [ ] Protected routes redirect
- [ ] Profile update saves

### Next Sprint Plan
**Week 1**: Complete auth + basic onboarding
**Week 2**: Aria integration + assessment
**Week 3**: Dr. Sage + Luna personas
**Week 4**: Full MSS integration + testing

### Current Bugs to Fix
1. Navigation to ActiveSession not working
2. Debug panel shows view changes but component doesn't render
3. Possible React state batching issue

The foundation is solid! Auth screens look beautiful with the glass morphism design. Once we fix navigation and wire up the auth flow, we'll have a complete user management system ready for the AI personas! 🎯
