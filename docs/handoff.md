## Session Update - January 3, 2025, 4:30 PM

### What Changed
- **Added End Session Confirmation Modal** - Prevents accidental data loss
  - Shows session summary (duration, total doses, product name)
  - Clear "Continue Session" and "End Session" buttons  
  - Glass aesthetic with smooth animations
  - Warning message that action cannot be undone
  
- **Improved End Button UX**
  - Added "End" label next to Square icon for clarity
  - Button now shows both icon and text
  
- **Added Success Feedback**
  - Toast notification displays "Session saved successfully!" after ending
  - Uses green-tinted glass style consistent with app design
  
- **Fixed ActiveSession Component**
  - Added showEndConfirm state for modal control
  - Added handleEndSession and confirmEndSession functions
  - Properly integrated with existing save flow

### Current State
- App running on http://localhost:5182/
- TypeScript compilation successful - no errors
- End confirmation modal properly integrated
- **ISSUE**: Navigation flow broken - can't navigate from ProductDetails to ActiveSession

### Open Items
- **CRITICAL**: Fix navigation from ProductDetails → ActiveSession
- Bell curve visualization still needs real-time updates
- Quick start feature (remembering last product) not yet implemented  
- StartScreen stats need real-time updates when returning from session
- PWA features (service worker for offline support) not implemented

### Next Actions
1. **Debug navigation issue** - Find why Start Session doesn't reach ActiveSession
2. **Test full flow once fixed** - Start → Track doses → End → Verify in stats
3. **Implement quick start** - Remember last product/dose for one-tap start
4. **Add real-time bell curve updates** - Make curve respond to elapsed time
5. **Add PWA features** - Service worker for offline support
### Assumptions Made
- Confirmation modal should show all key session metrics
- Success toast duration of 3 seconds is appropriate
- End button needs both icon and text for clarity
- Modal should use same glass aesthetic as rest of app
- User wants explicit confirmation to prevent data loss

### Files Touched
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/components/ActiveSession.tsx` (added confirmation modal and handlers)

## Navigation Issue Details
- Start Session button in ProductDetails should trigger handleStartWithPreset
- This should set activePreset and change currentView to 'session'
- Currently returns to ProductSelector instead
- Needs debugging of App.tsx state flow

## Current Issues
- ⚠️ **Navigation broken**: Can't reach ActiveSession from ProductDetails
- ✅ End confirmation modal added but untested due to navigation issue
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passing
- ✅ Dev server running on port 5182

## Testing Notes
- Confirmation modal code is complete and TypeScript-valid
- Modal shows session duration, total doses, and product name
- Success toast configured with green glass styling
- End button now shows "End" label for clarity

## Next Session Priority
1. Fix the navigation issue in App.tsx - debug why handleStartWithPreset isn't working
2. Once fixed, test the complete flow with the new confirmation modal
3. Verify session saves correctly and appears in stats
4. Test that success toast appears after session end
