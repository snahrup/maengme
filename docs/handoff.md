### What Changed - MASSIVE iOS UX OVERHAUL ðŸš€
1. **Gorgeous New Home Screen**
   - Glass morphism design with animated particles
   - Quick Start Hero with one-tap session launch
   - Stats Grid showing sessions, streak, duration, peak
   - Insights Panel with dynamic recommendations
   - Streak Widget with progress tracking

   - Personal greeting with time awareness
   - Bottom navigation bar

2. **Fixed Product Details Screen**
   - Mobile-responsive timeline layout
   - High-contrast START SESSION button (green gradient on black)
   - Fixed positioning with proper scroll padding
   - Timeline section no longer cut off
   - Proper safe areas for iOS

3. **Active Session Fixes**
   - BannerManager service for deduplication
   - No more banner spam/flashing
   - Coach marks for first-time users
   - Clear interaction model for ring control
   - Gesture disambiguation (tap vs long-press vs scroll)

4. **Quick Start Flow**
   - One-tap session start from home
   - Uses last session settings (product, dose, method)
   - 7-day retention for quick start data
   - Seamless flow from home to active session
   - Visual indicators when quick start is available

### Current State
- App running smoothly on localhost:5176
- All features functional
- TypeScript strict mode still disabled (temporary)
- Ready for iPhone testing
- Beautiful, engaging UI throughout

### Key Components Created

2. **Polish Items**
