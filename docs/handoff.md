   - Effect type selection with icons (Euphoria, Energy, Focus, etc.)
   - Contextual hints based on session phase
   - Clear "How are you feeling?" title
   - Optional notes field

2. **Clearer Interface Labels**
   - Phase names: "Waiting for Effects" instead of "Absorption Phase"
   - "Next phase in: X min" - clear timing info
   - "Quick Actions" label above buttons
   - Descriptive subtitles on buttons ("How you feel", "Log water", "Add thought")
   - Visual indicator (blue dot) prompting first effect log

3. **Help System Added**
   - Help button (?) in top nav
   - Modal explaining all features
   - Session phases explained
   - Visualization purpose clarified
   - Quick action descriptions

4. **Better Visual Context**
   - "Activity & Effects" label on visualizations
   - "Expected Timeline" label on bell curve
   - Clear phase progress bar
   - Encouraging feedback after actions

5. **First-Time User Experience**
   - Auto-prompt to log first effect after 3 seconds
   - Contextual hints throughout
   - Visual cues (pulsing dots) drawing attention
   - Encouraging messages after each action
