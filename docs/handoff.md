# MaengMe — Session Handoff Log

## Latest status
- **Branch:** master
- **Last commit:** a97133e - Complete v1 timer implementation with prime hints and persistence
- **Area:** Full v1 implementation complete
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/snahrup/maengme

## What changed this session
### Part 1 - Core Timer UI
- Built complete timer interface matching mockups
- Implemented RAF-based precision timer with useTimer hook
- Created TimerDisplay, LapChip, RadialTimeline, LapList components
- Applied Liquid Glass design system from tokens.json
- Set up PWA configuration with manifest
- Fixed TypeScript and build configuration issues
- Time formatting working (m:ss.mmm switches to h:mm:ss at 60:00)

### Part 2 - Intelligence & Persistence
- Implemented prime hint calculation from history (median ±20% window)
- Added Dexie database persistence for sessions
- Created HistoryView to browse past sessions
- Built SettingsView with export/import functionality
- Added RadialTimeline toggle button (center top)
- Integrated all features into cohesive app
- Created unit tests for time formatting (all passing)
- Pushed to GitHub repository

## Completed Features ✅
- [x] Precision timer with m:ss.mmm format
- [x] Start/Pause/Resume/End controls
- [x] Lap chips (Onset/Peak/Tail/No Effect) with single tap
- [x] Lap list with undo functionality  
- [x] RadialTimeline visualization with lap segments
- [x] Prime hint highlighting based on history
- [x] Session persistence to IndexedDB
- [x] History view to browse past sessions
- [x] Settings with prime hints toggle
- [x] Export/Import JSON functionality
- [x] PWA manifest configuration
- [x] Liquid Glass UI matching mockups
- [x] Unit tests for time formatting

## Open items (ordered)
1. Service worker for offline PWA functionality
2. Sound effects for lap logging
3. Product preset selection modal
4. E2E test for complete user flow
5. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
6. App store packaging (optional)

## Next actions (ready-to-execute)
- [ ] Add service worker for true offline support
- [ ] Create product selection modal
- [ ] Add tap sound effects (optional .mp3 files)
- [ ] Write E2E test with Playwright
- [ ] Deploy to production hosting

## Assumptions & decisions
- Using RAF for smooth 60fps timer updates
- Lap chips log immediately on tap (no confirmation)
- Glass morphism effects via backdrop-filter
- Cyan glow (#00D4FF) for radial timeline as per mockups
- Footer disclaimer "Not medical advice" always visible
- Prime windows calculated from last 20+ sessions
- RadialTimeline auto-shows when timer starts
- Sessions save automatically on End

## Verification checklist (tick if done)
- [x] Timer switches m:ss.mmm → h:mm:ss exactly at 60:00.000
- [x] Lap chips log in ≤1 tap, undo works
- [x] RadialTimeline renders segments, ~60fps
- [x] Prime hint window logic correct (±20%, N=20)
- [x] PWA manifest configured
- [x] Export/Import working
- [x] History view functional
- [x] Settings toggles working
- [x] No console errors; TS strict
- [x] Unit tests passing (4/4)
- [x] GitHub repository created and pushed
