# MaengMe — Session Handoff Log

## Latest Status ✅  
- **Branch:** master
- **Last commit:** cac7ad7 - Implement epoch-based timer and interactive timer with tap logging - Sprint 1 foundation
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/snahrup/maengme
- **Dev Server:** http://localhost:5175/ (currently running)
- **Build:** ✅ Clean - Building successfully

## Session Update - January 31, 2025 (3:58 PM PST)

### What Changed
- **Created useEpochTimer hook** - New epoch-based timer with pause/resume arrays for background reliability
- **Created InteractiveTimer component** - Tap-to-log intensity slider + phase ring visualization  
- **Implemented timer-tap logging** - Tap timer shows radial intensity (1-10), long-press opens detail
- **Added phase ring** - Visual indicator around timer showing onset/peak/tail phases
- **Background recovery** - Detects drift > 1s and shows recovery toast
- **Session persistence** - Timer state saved to localStorage for crash recovery
- **Integrated react-hot-toast** - For user feedback notifications
- **Updated ActiveSession** - Now uses InteractiveTimer instead of basic TimerDisplay

### Current State
- App running cleanly at http://localhost:5175/
- New timer interaction working (tap for radial, long-press for detail)
- Phase ring displaying around timer
- Background recovery implemented with drift detection
- Toast notifications integrated

### Open Items
- Age gate & consent flow not yet implemented
- Need to test timer interaction on actual device
- Phase ring timing needs product-specific tuning
- Simple Mode for first 3 sessions not started
- Performance optimization (reduce particles) not done

### Next Actions
1. **Test timer interaction** - Verify tap/long-press on actual mobile device
2. **Implement age gate** - Add first-run consent flow per legal requirements
3. **Add Simple Mode** - Progressive disclosure for first 3 sessions
4. **Optimize particles** - Reduce to 24-36 by default
5. **Test background recovery** - Lock screen mid-session to verify

### Assumptions Made
- Timer tap for intensity is primary logging method
- Long-press (500ms) opens detailed logging
- Phase ring uses product timing data when available
- Background drift > 1s triggers recovery toast
- Session recovery valid for 24 hours max

### Files Touched
- Created: `app/frontend/src/hooks/useEpochTimer.ts`
- Created: `app/frontend/src/components/InteractiveTimer.tsx`
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/App.tsx`
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/components/ActiveSession.tsx`
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/index.css`
- Modified: `app/frontend/package.json` (added react-hot-toast)
- Modified: `app/frontend/package-lock.json`

### Sprint 1 Progress
✅ Epoch-based timer with pause/resume arrays
✅ Timer-tap → radial slider interaction  
✅ Background recovery with drift detection
✅ Phase ring around timer
⏳ Age gate & consent flow (next priority)

### Key Design Decisions Implemented
- **Timer as logging trigger** - Successfully implemented tap/long-press
- **Radial intensity slider** - 1-10 scale with color coding
- **Phase ring visualization** - Onset (blue), Peak (purple), Tail (green)
- **Epoch math** - Using Date.now() for reliable timing
- **Recovery toasts** - User-friendly feedback for drift/recovery

### For Next Session
Continue Sprint 1:
1. Implement age gate and consent flow (P0 - Legal requirement)
2. Test timer interaction on real device
3. Add Simple Mode for onboarding
4. Begin performance optimizations

## Quick Start Command
```
Continue MaengMe - implement age gate/consent flow and test timer interaction on device
