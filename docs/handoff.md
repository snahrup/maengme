# MaengMe â€” Session Handoff Log

## Latest Status ðŸš€  
- **Branch:** master
- **Last commit:** eddfee0 - Add Vercel configuration for proper SPA routing
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/snahrup/maengme
- **Dev Server:** Starting fresh at port 5175
- **Build:** âœ… Clean build successful
- **Current Focus:** Complete iOS UX overhaul

## Session Update - January 31, 2025 (9:30 PM PST)

### Tonight's Mission
Complete 4-priority iOS UX overhaul based on user testing feedback:
1. **Gorgeous Home Screen** - Complete redesign with glass morphism, stats grid, quick start
2. **Fix Product Details** - Layout issues, illegible button, timeline cutoff
3. **Active Session Fixes** - Banner spam, ring interaction conflicts, coach marks
4. **Quick Start Flow** - One-tap session start from home using last settings

### Critical Issues from iOS Testing
- **Home screen is boring** - Needs complete visual overhaul
- **Banner spam** - "Mixed Maeng Da Extract typically begins in 5 minutes" repeating
- **Ring interaction conflicts** - Tap sometimes logs, sometimes opens modal, interferes with scroll
- **Product details broken** - Timeline cut off, Start button illegible
- **Session flow too long** - Takes way too many taps to start a session

### Implementation Plan
Each priority will be completed and committed separately to prevent work loss:
1. Update handoff â†’ Start Priority 1
2. Implement Home Screen â†’ commit & push
3. Implement Product Details Fix â†’ commit & push  
4. Implement Active Session Fixes â†’ commit & push
5. Implement Quick Start Flow â†’ commit & push
6. Final handoff update â†’ commit & push
