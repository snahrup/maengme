# MaengMe — Session Handoff Log

## Latest Status ✅  
- **Branch:** master
- **Last commit:** Pending (fixing console errors)
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/snahrup/maengme
- **Dev Server:** http://localhost:5181/ (currently running)
- **Build:** ⚠️ Has console warnings (NaN in BellCurve - now fixed)

## Session Update - January 31, 2025 (Evening)

### What Changed
- **Created DESIGN_DECISIONS.md** - Comprehensive documentation of all architectural decisions from audit review
- **Fixed BellCurve NaN errors** - Component was receiving wrong props (preset/currentTime instead of elapsed/laps)
- **Added safeguards** - All numeric calculations now have bounds checking and fallbacks
- **Documented future roadmap** - Sprint plan captured in design decisions doc

### Current State
- App running with BellCurve fixes applied
- Console errors should be resolved (NaN warnings eliminated)
- Design decisions documented but not yet implemented
- Core functionality still working (timer, product selection, session tracking)

### Open Items
- Implement timer-as-logging-trigger interaction
- Build phase ring around timer
- Add confidence scoring for ghost curves
- Implement Simple Mode for first 3 sessions
- Begin Sprint 1 items from design doc

### Next Actions
1. **Verify console is clean** - Check if NaN errors are gone
2. **Begin timer interaction** - Implement tap-for-radial logging
3. **Start phase ring** - Visual indicator around timer
4. **Add epoch-based timing** - Replace current timer with pausedAt/resumedAt arrays

### Assumptions Made
- BellCurve should use elapsed time and laps array, not preset object
- Numeric safeguards with fallbacks prevent NaN propagation
- Design decisions doc serves as implementation roadmap

### Files Touched
- Created: `docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/components/ActiveSession.tsx`
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/components/BellCurve.tsx`
- Modified: `docs/handoff.md`

### Key Design Decisions Documented
- **Timer = logging trigger** (tap for radial, long-press for detail)
- **Minimal particles by default** (24-36, Cinematic Mode optional)
- **Percentile bands** instead of single ghost curve
- **Phase ring** around timer (P0 priority)
- **Simple Mode** for onboarding
- **Epoch-based timing** for background reliability

### For Next Session
Start implementing Sprint 1 from DESIGN_DECISIONS.md:
1. Epoch-based timer with pause/resume arrays
2. Timer-tap → radial slider interaction
3. Background recovery with drift detection
4. Age gate & consent flow

## Quick Start Command
```
Continue MaengMe - implement timer-tap logging and epoch-based timing from DESIGN_DECISIONS.md Sprint 1
