## Session Update - January 3, 2025, 7:48 PM

### What Changed
- **Added Phase 1 Animation Features to Active Session**
  - AdaptiveParticles: Phase-responsive particle system with neural network connections
    - Particles scale from 5 (waiting) to 50 (peak) with color transitions
    - Intensity-based density and connection lines during peak
    - Blue → Yellow → Green → Purple color progression through phases
  - BreathingGlow: Ambient background animations
    - Multiple radial gradients with breathing rhythm
    - Phase-based colors and speed adjustments
    - Extra edge glows during peak phase
  
- **Added Debug Panel**  
  - Purple test tube icon in top-right corner
  - Shows current view, timer state, elapsed time
  - Displays preset and product selection status
  - Helps diagnose navigation issues

- **Code Quality Improvements**
  - Added intensity calculation (0-1) based on proximity to peak
  - Integrated animation components with z-index layering
  - Debug logging for view transitions

### Current State
- App running on http://localhost:5183/
- TypeScript compilation successful - no errors
- Animations integrated and working (pending navigation fix to test)
- **ISSUE**: Navigation from ProductDetails → ActiveSession still broken (investigating)
- Debug panel active for troubleshooting

### Open Items
- **CRITICAL**: Fix navigation bug - Start Session button not transitioning to ActiveSession view
- **User Concern**: ProductSelector may still show green theme (check browser cache)
- Test animations in actual session once navigation fixed
- Phase 2 features pending: Neural synapse animations at peak

### Next Actions
1. **Debug navigation with debug panel** - Monitor state changes during Start Session click
2. **Clear browser cache** - Ensure blue theme is visible in ProductSelector
3. **Test animation performance** - Verify smooth 60fps with particles
4. **Add Phase 2 features** once navigation works:
   - Electric synapse firing animations during peak buildup
   - Historical data integration for personalized timing
   - Pulse synchronization with expected peak time

### Assumptions Made
- Particle count and intensity should scale with session phase
- Neural connections only visible during onset/peak phases
- Background glow should breathe slower when calm, faster near peak
- Debug panel helps identify state management issues
- Performance throttling may be needed for older devices

### Files Touched
- Created: `app/frontend/src/components/AdaptiveParticles.tsx` (particle animation system)
- Created: `app/frontend/src/components/BreathingGlow.tsx` (ambient background effects)
- Created: `app/frontend/src/components/DebugPanel.tsx` (debugging tool)
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/components/ActiveSession.tsx` (integrated animations)
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/App.tsx` (added debug panel and logging)

## Animation System Details

### Phase Configuration
- **Waiting**: 5 particles, blue, slow movement (0.2 speed)
- **Onset**: 15 particles, yellow, medium movement (0.5 speed)
- **Peak**: 50 particles, green, fast movement (1.2 speed), neural connections
- **Comedown**: 10 particles, purple, slow movement (0.3 speed)

### Intensity Calculation
- 0-0.3 during waiting phase
- 0.3-0.8 during onset (linear ramp)
- 0.8-1.0 during peak (slight bell curve)
- 0.8-0.2 during comedown (gradual decrease)

## Current Issues
- ⚠️ **Navigation broken**: Debug panel shows view not changing to 'session'
- ⚠️ **ProductSelector theme**: User reports green theme still visible
- ✅ Animations implemented but untested in live session
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passing
- ✅ Dev server running on port 5183

## Testing Notes
- Debug panel accessible via purple test tube icon
- Console logs added for view transitions
- Animations use GPU acceleration (transform3d)
- Particle connections only render when count < 150 distance

## Next Session Priority
1. Use debug panel to identify why navigation fails
2. Force browser refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear cache
3. Test full animation flow in active session
4. Optimize performance if needed
5. Add Phase 2 neural synapse features
