# MaengMe Handoff Document

## Session Update - January 3, 2025, 8:39 PM

### What Changed
- Fixed Netlify deployment error caused by missing dependencies
- Added `date-fns` (^3.6.0) and `react-router-dom` (^6.22.3) to package.json
- Fixed QuickStartHero component to remove react-router-dom usage (app uses state-based navigation)
- Updated QuickStartHero to accept onStartSession and onSelectProduct props
- Updated HomeScreen to pass proper navigation props to QuickStartHero
- Successfully built project with no TypeScript errors

### Current State
- App builds successfully with `npm run build`
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- Netlify deployment should now succeed
- Dev server not currently running
- No console errors or warnings

### Open Items
- Monitor Netlify deployment to confirm fix worked
- No other pending issues

### Next Actions
1. Verify Netlify deployment succeeds
2. Continue with feature development if deployment successful
3. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling

### Assumptions Made
- Used date-fns v3.6.0 (latest stable)
- Kept react-router-dom in dependencies even though not currently used (may be needed later)
- Component navigation through props is preferred over routing library for this PWA

### Files Touched
- Modified: `app/frontend/package.json` (added missing dependencies)
- Modified: `app/frontend/package-lock.json` (updated with new dependencies)
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/components/home/QuickStartHero.tsx` (removed router, added props)
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/components/HomeScreen.tsx` (pass props to QuickStartHero)
- Created: `docs/handoff.md` (this file)

## Deployment Fix Summary

The Netlify deployment was failing with TypeScript errors:
- `TS2307: Cannot find module 'react-router-dom'`
- `TS2307: Cannot find module 'date-fns'`

These dependencies were missing from package.json. After adding them and refactoring the components to use the app's existing state-based navigation (instead of react-router-dom), the build succeeds.

The app uses a state-based navigation system where view changes are handled through the `currentView` state in App.tsx, not through React Router. Components receive navigation callbacks as props.
