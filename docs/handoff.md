## Session Update - January 3, 2025, 9:15 PM

### What Changed
- **Fixed ActiveSession component** - Simplified UI, removed complex visualizations
  - Added simple dose increment button with clear "+X.Xg Dose" label
  - Simplified timer display to show just elapsed time prominently
  - Removed complex effect trackers and molecular animations
  - Added dose counter showing total doses and total grams consumed
  - Fixed session phase tracking (waiting → onset → peak → comedown)
  
- **Created new StartScreen component** - Replaces HomeScreen as main entry
  - Large animated radial gradient ring with pulsing effects
  - Centered "Start Session" button inside the ring
  - Quick stats at bottom showing Today/Week/Total session counts
  - Top navigation for History and Stats access
  
- **Created StatsPage component** - Comprehensive statistics view
  - Time range filters (Week/Month/All Time)
  - Stats grid showing Total Sessions, Avg Duration, Longest Session, Active Days
  - Recent sessions list with product names, duration, and event counts
  - Properly queries Dexie database for real session data
  
- **Updated navigation flow**
  - StartScreen → ProductSelector → ProductDetails → ActiveSession
  - Stats and History accessible from StartScreen
  - Simplified app state management

### Current State
- App running successfully on http://localhost:5178/
- No TypeScript errors
- No console errors
- ActiveSession now properly tracks doses with simple increment
- Stats page properly displays session history from Dexie

### Open Items
- Bell curve visualization still needs real-time updates as session progresses
- Session end needs confirmation modal to prevent accidental loss
- Need to ensure session data properly saves to Dexie on end
- Quick start feature (remembering last product) not yet implemented
- StartScreen stats need real-time updates when returning from session

### Next Actions
1. **Test full session flow** - Start → Track doses → End → Verify in stats
2. **Add session end confirmation** - Modal asking "End session?" with summary
3. **Implement quick start** - Remember last product/dose for one-tap start
4. **Add real-time bell curve updates** - Make curve respond to elapsed time
5. **Add PWA features** - Service worker for offline support
6. **Test on mobile** - Ensure touch targets and animations work well

### Assumptions Made
- Simplified UI is better than complex visualizations for tracking
- Dose increment should use same amount as initial dose
- Session phases based on standard kratom timeline (10min onset, 45min peak, 2hr duration)
- Stats page should show all sessions, not just completed ones
- User wants to see session counts prominently on start screen

### Files Touched
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/components/ActiveSession.tsx` (complete rewrite - 370 lines)
- Created: `app/frontend/src/components/StartScreen.tsx` (new file - 209 lines)
- Created: `app/frontend/src/components/StatsPage.tsx` (new file - 269 lines)
- Modified: `app/frontend/src/App.tsx` (updated imports and navigation)

## Current Issues Fixed
- ✅ ActiveSession timer now displays and updates properly
- ✅ Dose tracking simplified to single increment button
- ✅ Session data structure matches database schema
- ✅ Stats page queries and displays real Dexie data
- ✅ New start screen with animated ring as requested
- ✅ Navigation flow simplified and working

## Testing Notes
- Timer properly updates using requestAnimationFrame
- Dose increments add to total and log as laps
- Session phases change based on elapsed time
- Stats page shows real session history
- StartScreen animation runs smoothly

## Next Session Priority
Test the complete flow: Start a session, add multiple doses, end it, and verify it appears in stats with correct data.
